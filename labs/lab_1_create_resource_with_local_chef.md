# Lab 1 Create a resource with local Chef

---
KEY POINTS:
* A Chef resource describes one part of the system, such as a file, a template, or a package.

* A Chef recipe is a file that groups related resources, such as everything needed to configure a web server, database server, or a load balancer.

## Setup your Docker environment and install Chef-DK

```ã€€
#create env 
docker run -ti -p 8080:80 --name chef_wk ubuntu:14.04 bash 

Once inside the container, please run:

#install chef dk 
apt-get update 
apt-get -y install curl vim nano
curl https://omnitruck.chef.io/install.sh | bash -s -- -P chefdk -c stable -v 0.18.30 
```

## Create a file with chef-client

By this point you have the chef development kit installed. Let's try it out:

Please type:
```
cd 
mkdir /root/chef-repo 
cd chef-repo/ 
```

Now with vim or nano, create a file called /root/chef-repo/hello.rb with the following content:

```
file '/tmp/motd' do 
  content 'hello world
  ' 
end 
```
Finally, run the following command:

```
chef-client  --local-mode hello.rb 
```

The command above instructed chef to create a message of the day file in the /tmp directory. To verify it:

```
root@df67a8dfd2d7:~/chef-repo# cat /tmp/motd 
hello world
```

---

Let's run again the same command:

```
chef-client  --local-mode hello.rb 
```


Why nothing changed?

Chef looks at the current configuration state and applies the action only if the current state doesn't match the desired state. Here, Chef doesn't create or modify /tmp/motd because it already exists and its contents didn't change. We call this approach **test and repair**. 

---

## Change the managed file 

1. Modify the content of /tmp/motd
2. Run the chef-cliet command as above. What happened with the content of /tmp/motd? Why? 

## Configure a package and a service

The recibe below will perform a few action:
1. Update the apt cache daily
2. Install the apache web server
3. Set up a hello wold file for our web server.

To achieve this, you can create /root/chef-repo/web.rb with the following content:

```
apt_update 'Update the apt cache daily' do 
  frequency 86_400 
  action :periodic 
end 

package 'apache2' 

service 'apache2' do 
  supports :status => true 
  action [:enable, :start] 
end 

file '/var/www/html/index.html' do 
  content '<html> 
  <body> 
    <h1>hello world</h1> 
  </body> 
</html>' 
end 

```

Now execute: 

```
chef-client  --local-mode web.rb 
```

To verify everything is working correctly, you can run

```
curl http://localhost 
```

Your output should be: 

```
<html> 
  <body> 
    <h1>hello world</h1> 
  </body> 
</html>
```

From your host machine you can go to http://VM_IP:8080 to get the Apache web page.
